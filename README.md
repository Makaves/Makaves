- 👋 Hi, I’m Makaves a student at campus
- 👀 I’m interested in learning html css and javascript for web design and development
- 🌱 I’m currently learning information technology at my university
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anyone here at github since it home for all developers
- 📫 You can send email to me via born13august@gmail.com and I will appreciate.

I look forward to working with great minds here at github.Am familiar with basics of html and css and have done some front end projects by creating some sites using html and css only.
As I advance to web design and development I would like to venture into deep css and explore javascript.
